## [2.0.0] - undefined

### Added

- Settings are now grouped into categories and cached for faster access.
- New "Batches" page in the admin area shows videos, channels and offers together.
- All expiration times for links now follow one consistent rule.
- New `ingest:unzip` command extracts pending archives automatically.
- Scheduler entry for `ingest:unzip` runs the extraction every ten minutes.
- Shared locking via `LockJobTrait` prevents parallel runs of ingest commands.
- Admin panel includes a log viewer for inspecting application logs.
- Admin panel includes a Dropbox connect page for linking accounts.
- **Dropbox connect page now shows the access token expiration date when the account is connected.**
- Deployment guide added to the documentation.

### Changed

- The way the app reads settings has changed. If you have custom tools that fetch settings, they may need updates.
- Standardized batch handling by introducing `BatchTypeEnum` and migrating usages from the previously mixed enum.
- `ingest:scan` now supports lock options and a configurable target disk.
- Cron failures send notifications to the admin email setting instead of a fixed address.

### Removed

- Removed the old type enum and related aliases. **Breaking change:** public APIs now accept `BatchTypeEnum`.

### Fixed

- **ClipsRelationManager** now correctly displays values in the **Video** resource.

## [1.2.1] - 2025-08-18

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where `expire_at` was not set if a link was never visited, causing video-to-channel assignments to
  never expire. `expire_at` is now reliably set and expirations are enforced regardless of link access.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-08-14

### Added

- Settings can now be changed directly in the browser, with clear labels and safe defaults.
- Each setting understands its type (text, number, yes/no, list), making wrong entries less likely.

### Changed

- Download links opened from the admin area no longer count toward viewer statistics.
- The lifetime of download links can be adjusted in the new settings screen.
- Importing clip information from CSV files is more forgiving and gives clearer warnings.
- Dropbox connections treat empty tokens as missing, reducing sync errors.

### Fixed

- General reliability improvements and more automated tests.

## [1.1.3] - 2025-08-14

### Added

- MIT license clarifies how the software can be used.
- Many more automated tests to catch problems early.

### Changed

- The video dashboard now has a simpler date filter.
- Video code tidied up for smoother performance.
- Tests skip the weekly maintenance task so checks run faster.

### Removed

- Old channel notification emails that were no longer used.

## [1.1.2] - 2025-08-13

### Changed

- Added many new automated tests so issues are caught before they affect you.
- Removed outdated code to keep the app running smoothly.
- Updated project documentation for clearer setup instructions.

### Fixed

- Small fixes across the app for better stability.

## [1.1.1] - 2025-08-12

### Changed

- Made session cookie name environment-aware. In config/session.php the default 'cookie' now includes the APP_ENV
  suffix (e.g., myapp_session_staging). You can still override via SESSION_COOKIE.

### Fixed

- Resolved intermittent 419 Page Expired errors on staging (Filament/Livewire) caused by cross-environment cookie name
  collisions. Set SESSION_COOKIE=staging_session and cleared config cache.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-08-11

### Added

  server configuration.
