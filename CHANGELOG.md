# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.1] - 2025-08-18

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where `expire_at` was not set if a link was never visited, causing video-to-channel assignments to
  never expire. `expire_at` is now reliably set and expirations are enforced regardless of link access.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-08-14

### Added

- Settings can now be changed directly in the browser, with clear labels and safe defaults.
- Each setting understands its type (text, number, yes/no, list), making wrong entries less likely.

### Changed

- Download links opened from the admin area no longer count toward viewer statistics.
- The lifetime of download links can be adjusted in the new settings screen.
- Importing clip information from CSV files is more forgiving and gives clearer warnings.
- Dropbox connections treat empty tokens as missing, reducing sync errors.

### Fixed

- General reliability improvements and more automated tests.

## [1.1.3] - 2025-08-14

### Added

- MIT license clarifies how the software can be used.
- Many more automated tests to catch problems early.

### Changed

- The video dashboard now has a simpler date filter.
- Video code tidied up for smoother performance.
- Tests skip the weekly maintenance task so checks run faster.

### Removed

- Old channel notification emails that were no longer used.

## [1.1.2] - 2025-08-13

### Changed

- Added many new automated tests so issues are caught before they affect you.
- Removed outdated code to keep the app running smoothly.
- Updated project documentation for clearer setup instructions.

### Fixed

- Small fixes across the app for better stability.

## [1.1.1] - 2025-08-12

### Changed

- Made session cookie name environment-aware. In config/session.php the default 'cookie' now includes the APP_ENV
  suffix (e.g., myapp_session_staging). You can still override via SESSION_COOKIE.

### Fixed

- Resolved intermittent 419 Page Expired errors on staging (Filament/Livewire) caused by cross-environment cookie name
  collisions. Set SESSION_COOKIE=staging_session and cleared config cache.

### Added

- Comprehensive setup guides and workflow documentation, including examples for queue worker and production Reverb
  server configuration.
