## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **User Model Integration Tests**
    - Added comprehensive **integration tests** for the `User` model to ensure correct behavior of  
      authentication- and identity-related functionality.
    - Covered the following areas:
        - `display_name` accessor resolution with and without `submitted_name`.
        - Persistence and retrieval of encrypted fields  
          (`app_authentication_secret`, `app_authentication_recovery_codes`).
        - Toggle behavior and persistence of `has_email_authentication`.
        - Filament panel access validation via `canAccessPanel()`.
    - Strengthened overall reliability of user authentication logic and ensured  
      compatibility with Filament’s multi-factor authentication system.

### Fixed

- **Video Model**
    - Fixed a `TypeError` in `getPreviewPath()` that occurred when no clip preview existed.  
      Added a null check before verifying file existence on the storage disk to ensure  
      safe and predictable behavior when preview files are missing.

## [3.0.0-alpha.3] - 2025-10-31

### Added

- **Ingest System Stabilization**
    - Added comprehensive **feature and integration tests** for the `ingest:scan` command to ensure consistent file
      handling, duplicate detection, and batch statistics integrity.
    - Introduced fixture-based test structure using real video samples to validate the complete ingest workflow
      end-to-end.
    - Improved test coverage for concurrent ingest lock handling to prevent race conditions.
    - Added verification of file deletion and content-addressed video storage consistency.
    - Strengthened overall reliability and maintainability through systematic test-driven validation of ingest
      processes.

- **Mail Handling Stability**
    - Added comprehensive **unit tests** for `InboundHandler` to ensure reliable inbound message parsing and repository
      integration.
    - Added coverage for subject parsing, header extraction, and duplicate-mail detection to prevent re-processing of
      previously handled messages.
    - Implemented mocking of Webklex IMAP message flow (`Header`, `Attribute`, and `Message` chains) to validate correct
      handling without external dependencies.
    - Improved overall mail ingestion reliability through precise, type-safe test validation of handler logic and log
      events.

- **Mail Logging Reliability**
    - Added a dedicated **integration test** for the `LogSentMail` listener to verify creation of `MailLog` entries
      after
      successful mail dispatch through Laravel’s `array` mailer.
    - Ensures message headers, subject, recipient, and HTML content are persisted correctly in the database.
    - Confirms automatic generation of UUID-based internal IDs and RFC-compliant message identifiers.
    - Validated full compatibility with Laravel 12’s Mailable and Event system (no deprecated `build()` or
      `SentMessage` usage).

- **Channel Welcome Mail Refactor**
    - Introduced a fully refactored **`SendChannelWelcomeMailCommand`** with clear separation of responsibilities
      between
      command, service, and repository layers.
    - Added a new **`ChannelService`** to encapsulate all business logic related to channel approval and welcome mail
      distribution.
    - Introduced a dedicated **`ChannelRepository`** providing reusable data-access methods (`getActiveChannels`,
      `getPendingApproval`, `findById`, `findByEmail`).
    - Implemented dependency injection across command and service for cleaner, testable architecture.
    - Retained all German CLI output to ensure backward compatibility with existing feature tests.

- **Channel Command & Repository Tests**
    - Added extensive **feature tests** for the `channels:send-welcome` command covering dry-run mode, targeted sending
      by
      ID or email, `--force` behavior, and mail dispatch validation.
    - Introduced **integration tests** for the new `ChannelService`, verifying channel preparation, approval token
      validation, eligibility selection, and mail delivery.
    - Added **repository-level integration tests** for all query methods, ensuring correct filtering, ordering, and
      handling of null/invalid lookups.
    - Ensured comprehensive mail testing using `Mail::fake()` and queue assertions to validate real send behavior.
    - Improved overall maintainability and reliability of the channel mail system through isolated, layered test
      coverage.

- **Mail Handling Stability**
    - Added comprehensive **integration tests** for the listeners  
      `SendChannelCreatedNotification` and `SendWelcomeMail`,  
      ensuring correct triggering and welcome mail dispatch behavior.
    - Tests cover both direct listener invocation and automatic event registration  
      via the Laravel event dispatcher.
    - Includes scenarios with and without valid email addresses, verifying queue behavior  
      (`Mail::queue` vs. `Mail::send`) for stable runtime handling.
    - Unified use of `Mail::fake()` across all listener tests for consistent, type-safe mail verification.

- **Clip Ownership Preparation**
    - Added a new nullable `user_id` column to the **`clips`** table to establish a future link between clips and their
      uploaders.
    - Extended the **`Clip`** model with a `user()` relationship and a new `setUser()` helper for consistent assignment
      of both `user_id` and `submitted_by` attributes.
    - Updated the **`ProcessUploadedVideo`** job to automatically associate newly created clips with the uploading user,
      preserving backward compatibility with the existing `submitted_by` field.
    - Implemented the migration as part of a gradual transition towards full **user-based ownership** of clips, allowing
      mixed legacy and new data during rollout.

### Changed

- **User Profile Uniqueness**
    - Enforced uniqueness for both `name` and `submitted_by` fields within user profiles to prevent duplicate
      identifiers.
    - This change ensures a one-to-one mapping between profile names and submission identities, improving data
      reliability across clip attribution, audit logs, and activity tracking.
    - Existing data remains unaffected; uniqueness is applied only to new or updated records going forward.

### Fixed

- **Mail Handling Robustness**
    - Improved `SendWelcomeMail` listener resilience by adding internal `try/catch` handling  
      to prevent crashes when Mail queue dispatch fails.
    - Prevented runtime exceptions during queued mail operations,  
      ensuring graceful degradation and consistent event processing under failure conditions.

- **Clip Attribution Consistency**
    - Fixed an issue where newly created clips were not using the authenticated user’s `display_name` for the
      `submitted_by` field.
    - The `ProcessUploadedVideo` job now consistently delegates ownership handling to the `Clip::setUser()` method,
      ensuring that both `user_id` and `submitted_by` are aligned.
    - This resolves inconsistent attribution between stored clips and their actual uploader identity, improving audit
      trail accuracy and data integrity.

- **Footer Rendering in Filament Panels**
    - Fixed an issue where the global footer would overlap or shift upward on pages containing file upload components.
    - The footer is now **excluded** from the Filament video upload page to prevent layout distortion caused by nested
      scroll containers.
    - This ensures stable layout behavior during video uploads while keeping consistent footer rendering across all
      other admin views.

## [3.0.0-alpha.2] - 2025-10-31

> **Note:** This is the first production deployment of the new 3.x architecture.  
> It represents a major structural and functional refactor compared to 2.5.0,  
> introducing a unified ingestion pipeline, real-time ZIP download system,  
> and a GDPR-compliant channel approval & communication flow.  
> Existing channels and assignments remain compatible.

### Added

- **Offer Link Tracking**
    - Introduced a new `offer_link_clicks` table to record when a channel opens the offer overview page.
    - Each valid (signed) request to `OfferController::show()` now creates a record containing:
        - References to `batch_id` and `channel_id`.
        - Timestamp of access (`clicked_at`).
        - Optional `user_agent` for basic analytics.
    - Multiple visits by the same channel are counted individually to reflect real viewing behavior.
    - Added a Filament admin resource **Offer Link Clicks** under *Statistics*:
        - Displays all recorded clicks with batch and channel relations.
        - Fully sortable by date and searchable by channel name.
    - Tracking is only performed for valid signed links (`ensureValidSignature()`).
    - Existing download tracking remains unchanged.

- **User Welcome Email System**
    - Introduced a fully automated welcome email workflow for newly created users.
    - Added `UserCreated` event and corresponding `SendWelcomeMail` listener.
    - Implemented `UserWelcomeMail` Mailable, supporting both self-registrations and backend-created accounts.
    - When users are created via the Filament admin panel:
        - A random password is automatically generated if none is provided.
        - The plaintext password is included in the welcome email (only for backend-created users).
    - Emails use contextual templates based on creation source:
        - **Frontend users:** Standard welcome message.
        - **Backend-created users:** Account access details included.
    - Added localized subject lines and structured Blade email layout with footer links (Impressum, Datenschutz,
      Nutzungsbedingungen, etc.).
    - All emails are logged and sent asynchronously through Laravel’s mail queue system.
    - Security-conscious handling ensures that plaintext passwords are **never stored** in the database — only
      transmitted once via the initial welcome email.

### Changed

- **Download System**
    - The ZIP downloader now supports **single video downloads** through the unified `ZipDownloader` workflow.  
      Instead of triggering a direct file link, the “Download Single” button now invokes the same process used  
      for batch downloads — including the real-time progress modal, WebSocket (Echo) events, and unified logging.
    - Consolidated logic for single and multiple downloads via the common `startDownload()` method.
    - Added optional parameter handling for forced assignment IDs to enable clean reuse of the modal-based flow.
    - Improved code readability and reliability:
        - Consistent file name sanitization for both single and multi downloads.
        - Graceful handling of missing selections or invalid assignment states.
        - Minor structural refactoring for clarity and maintainability.

- **Offer Controller Refactor**
    - Extracted all offer preparation logic (assignment fetching, temp URL generation, ZIP link creation)
      from `OfferController` into a dedicated `OfferService`.
    - New method `OfferService::prepareOfferViewData()` centralizes data preparation for the offer view.
    - Controller now only handles request validation (`ensureValidSignature`) and delegates data loading to the service.
    - Improves separation of concerns, readability, and future testability.

### Deprecated

- **Legacy Assignment Download Controller**
    - Marked `AssignmentDownloadController` as **deprecated** in favor of the new real-time WebSocket-based download
      flow handled by `ZipController`.
    - The legacy implementation previously managed direct single-file downloads via signed URLs and stream responses.
    - All functionality has been superseded by the new zip-based asynchronous download process, which:
        - Tracks download progress via WebSocket events.
        - Supports batch and individual video downloads.
        - Provides improved error handling and download verification.
    - The old controller remains temporarily available for backward compatibility but will be removed in a future
      release.

### Removed

- **Legacy Ingest Process & Components**
    - Removed the deprecated `IngestScan` command and related legacy ingest components.
    - Functionality has been fully replaced by the new modular `IngestScanner` pipeline and supporting services.
    - The refactored ingest architecture now provides transactional safety, unified logging, and service-based
      extensibility across all entrypoints (web and CLI).

- **Legacy Preview Service & FFmpeg Components**
    - Removed all deprecated classes and helpers related to the old `PreviewService` implementation.
    - The former preview generation logic (manual FFmpeg invocation, direct filesystem access, and inline parameter
      handling)
      has been fully replaced by the new **modular preview pipeline** powered by `pbmedia/laravel-ffmpeg`.
    - Preview rendering is now configuration-driven and integrated with the `DynamicStorageService` for consistent,
      driver-agnostic file access.
    - This cleanup eliminates redundant code paths, ensures better stability, and aligns all preview operations with the
      new ingest architecture.

## [3.0.0-alpha] - 2025-10-30

### Added

- **Auth**
    - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) with support for authenticator apps (TOTP) and one-time codes via email.
    - Email verification and change verification for secure and verified user identities.
    - Automatic role assignment via `UserObserver`, assigning the default `panel_user` role to newly created
      users. ([#126](https://github.com/N3XT0R/dashclip-delivery/issues/126))

- **Admin Panel**
    - Role and permission management via Filament Shield (integrates Spatie Laravel Permission with the admin panel,
      providing a full UI for roles, permissions, and access
      control). ([#126](https://github.com/N3XT0R/dashclip-delivery/issues/126))
    - Initial roles and permissions seeder generated via `php artisan shield:seeder`, providing default admin access and
      baseline permission data. ([#126](https://github.com/N3XT0R/dashclip-delivery/issues/126))
    - Web-based video upload in the admin UI, complementing existing ingest workflows.
        - Ensures a valid preview range is available even if the user doesn't manually
          adjust the start/end time after upload.

- **Ingest & Upload Refactor** ([#152](https://github.com/N3XT0R/dashclip-delivery/issues/152))
    - Introduced a fully modular ingestion pipeline with transactional safety and storage abstraction.
    - Added `IngestResult` enum for standardized ingest return values.
    - Added `IngestStats` value object for batch statistics and aggregation.
    - Added dedicated exception classes for clearer flow control and debugging:
        - `InvalidTimeRangeException` — thrown when preview clip ranges are invalid.
        - `PreviewGenerationException` — includes contextual metadata for FFmpeg errors.
    - Added new `App\Services\Ingest\IngestScanner` (modular replacement of legacy class).
    - Added `CsvService` for isolated metadata (CSV) import.
    - Implemented unified logging and consistent exception handling across CLI and web ingest.
    - Integrated **Laravel-FFmpeg** for preview generation with dynamic codec, preset, and parameter configuration.
    - Added full database transaction handling (`DB::beginTransaction`, `commit`, `rollback`) during video processing.
    - Introduced `DynamicStorageService` and `DynamicStorage` facade for transparent, driver-agnostic file access:
        - Automatically builds a Laravel `Filesystem` instance for any given path (local, Dropbox, S3, etc.).
        - Provides recursive file listing via `listFiles()` returning `FileInfoDto` objects.
        - Replaces all direct filesystem calls (`fopen`, `unlink`, `hash_file`, etc.) with stream-safe equivalents.
        - Implements efficient hashing (`sha256`) using stream-based `hash_update_stream` for large files.
        - Enables consistent file handling across CLI and Web contexts through the same unified API layer.

- **CSV Import**
    - Introduced `ClipImportResult` value object to encapsulate import outcomes:
        - Tracks created, updated, and warning counts.
        - Optionally aggregates references to affected `Clip` models.
        - Enables downstream traceability and structured reporting for batch imports.
    - Added strong-typed result flow (`ClipImportResult` → `ImportStats`) replacing mutable array counters.
    - Added dedicated method signatures to support typed aggregation in `processRow`, `updateClipIfDirty`, and
      `createClip`.
    - Added improved error handling and warning tracking for malformed or missing data rows.
    - Added `importInfoFromDisk()` and `importFromStream()` methods for driver-agnostic import via `Filesystem`
      (compatible with `DynamicStorageService`).

- **Configuration**
    - Config table now supports a `selectable` JSON column so settings can offer predefined choices.
    - New FFMPEG configuration category seeds codec, preset and parameter defaults for preview generation.
    - Admin UI renders selectable values for JSON-based settings as multi-select inputs.

- **System Monitoring**
    - Integrated Spatie Activity Log for detailed user and system activity tracking.
    - Added ActivityResource in the System section of the admin panel for viewing, filtering, and inspecting user
      actions.
    - Each log entry records the affected model, action type, timestamp, and the responsible user (causer).
    - Activity logs include CRUD operations as well as custom system events (e.g. login, configuration changes).
    - Added observer integration for automatic logging of key model events (create, update, delete).

- **Mail Infrastructure**
    - Introduced `InboundHandler` implementing `MessageStrategyInterface` to process incoming IMAP messages.
    - Inbound mails are now stored via the central `MailRepository`, including message ID, sender, subject,
      direction (`MailDirection::INBOUND`), and status (`MailStatus::Received`).
    - Header and raw body data are preserved as structured metadata (`meta.headers`, `meta.content`).
    - Duplicate message detection prevents reprocessing based on message ID.
    - Fully RFC-conform handling of inbound timestamps and header parsing via `Carbon` conversion.
    - Logging of inbound mail events for traceability and debugging.

- **Version Service**
    - Introduced `LocalVersionService` implementing `VersionServiceInterface` for retrieving the current application
      version directly via `Composer\InstalledVersions`.  
      The service reads the root package version from the installed Composer metadata and supports an optional fallback
      callable for non-standard environments.  
      Added a new `Version` Facade providing simple access to the version across the application.

- **Channel Approval & Welcome Flow**
    - Introduced a complete opt-in workflow for newly created channels to ensure GDPR-compliant approval before video
      delivery begins.
    - Added `approved_at` column to the `channels` table for timestamped consent tracking.
    - New `ChannelApprovalController` validates approval tokens and activates channels via secure hash-based
      confirmation links.
    - Added `ChannelWelcomeMail` mailable:
        - Sends personalized welcome and approval request emails using a friendly, non-formal tone (du-form).
        - Includes a unique confirmation link (`approveUrl`) leading to a dedicated approval page.
    - Implemented new Blade views:
        - `emails/channel-welcome.blade.php` for the email layout.
        - `channels/approved.blade.php` for the confirmation page shown after approval.
    - Introduced new Artisan command `channels:send-welcome`:
        - Allows sending approval mails manually or in bulk.
        - Supports `--dry` mode (preview recipients without sending).
        - Supports `--force` mode (resend even if already approved).
    - Fully documented process with minimal data handling — no IP storage — to comply with privacy and data-minimization
      requirements.

### Fixed

- **Dropbox-Upload**
    - Fixed an issue where small files (≤ 8 MB) were not uploaded to Dropbox correctly.  
      The upload session was started but never finished because files smaller than the configured `CHUNK_SIZE`
      did not trigger the session finish step.  
      Small files are now handled via a direct `upload()` call instead of a chunked session upload.

- **Video Deletion**
    - Fixed an issue where video and preview files were not reliably deleted when removing a `Video` record.  
      Introduced a new `getPreviewPath()` method on the `Video` model to correctly resolve preview file paths,  
      including fallback to the associated `Clip` when the primary preview is missing.  
      The deletion logic in the model’s `booted()` method now ensures both original and preview files are  
      properly removed across different storage disks, with improved error handling and logging.

### Changed

- **Framework**
    - Backend upgraded to Filament v4 (UI components and pages migrated).
    - Preview generation now uses the `pbmedia/laravel-ffmpeg` package and reads all codec options from the database.

- **Ingest Architecture** ([#152](https://github.com/N3XT0R/dashclip-delivery/issues/152))
    - Replaced all direct filesystem operations (`fopen`, `unlink`, `hash_file`) with the new `DynamicStorageService`
      abstraction.
    - `DynamicStorageService` now acts as the central access layer for all file operations:
        - Transparently builds `Filesystem` adapters for local, Dropbox, or S3 disks.
        - Provides a unified API for recursive file listing, hashing, and streaming.
        - Uses efficient stream-based hashing to support very large files.
        - Ensures consistent file handling between CLI (cron) and web contexts.
    - Preview generation is now model-independent; `PreviewService` no longer depends on `Video` Eloquent models.
    - Unified code path for web uploads and CLI (cron) ingestion.
    - Clear separation of concerns:
        - `VideoService` — handles video metadata and persistence.
        - `PreviewService` — handles preview rendering.
        - `UploadService` / `DropboxUploadService` — handles upload and remote storage transfer.
    - Added full rollback safety for video creation, CSV import, and upload operations.
    - Logging unified for CLI and web contexts with improved error tracing.
      Integrated **Laravel-FFmpeg** for preview generation, replacing the previous custom FFmpeg implementation.
        - Now fully parameterized via database configuration (codec, preset, additional parameters).
        - Provides improved stability, consistent error handling, and framework-native integration.

- **InfoImporter**
    - Refactored to use `ClipImportResult` instead of primitive array-based `$stats`.
    - Replaced legacy counter passing (`&$stats`) with immutable, typed result aggregation.
    - Updated all internal pipeline methods:
        - `processRow()` now receives and updates a `ClipImportResult` instance.
        - `findVideoOrWarn()`, `updateClipIfDirty()`, and `createClip()` now contribute structured results.
    - Unified return values and removed duplicate stat calculation logic.
    - Improved naming consistency and method visibility (private helpers now focused on single responsibility).
    - Enhanced readability and maintainability by removing nested array manipulation patterns.

- **Uploads**
    - Increased maximum upload size to **1 GB** to support large video files.
    - Extended maximum upload time to **25 minutes** (≈ 5.5 Mbit/s minimum speed).
    - Optimized for real-world conditions - fully LTE-capable for mobile uploads.
    - Updated Livewire configuration (`config/livewire.php`) for smoother large uploads.

- **UI**
    - Refined layout spacing, label hierarchy, and visual alignment for improved readability.
    - Updated Filament resources and forms to align with v4 design patterns.

- **Filament v4 migration**
    - May require adjustments to custom admin pages, widgets, or themes.

- `ingest:scan` now supports lock options and a configurable target disk.
- Cron failures send notifications to the admin email setting instead of a fixed address.

## [1.2.1] - 2025-08-18

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where `expire_at` was not set if a link was never visited, causing video-to-channel assignments to
  never expire. `expire_at` is now reliably set and expirations are enforced regardless of link access.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-08-14

### Added

- Settings can now be changed directly in the browser, with clear labels and safe defaults.
- Each setting understands its type (text, number, yes/no, list), making wrong entries less likely.

### Changed

- Download links opened from the admin area no longer count toward viewer statistics.
- The lifetime of download links can be adjusted in the new settings screen.
- Importing clip information from CSV files is more forgiving and gives clearer warnings.
- Dropbox connections treat empty tokens as missing, reducing sync errors.

### Fixed

- General reliability improvements and more automated tests.

## [1.1.3] - 2025-08-14

  suffix (e.g., myapp_session_staging). You can still override via SESSION_COOKIE.

### Fixed

- Resolved intermittent 419 Page Expired errors on staging (Filament/Livewire) caused by cross-environment cookie name
  collisions. Set SESSION_COOKIE=staging_session and cleared config cache.
