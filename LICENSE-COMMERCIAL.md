## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: I'm running a commercial dashcam channel. Do I need a commercial license?

**A:** If you keep all your modifications open source (AGPL-3.0) and provide access to your source code to all users of
your service, you can use the free AGPL-3.0 license. If you want to keep modifications private, you need a commercial
license.

### Q: Can I evaluate the software before purchasing?

**A:** Yes! You can freely evaluate DashClip Delivery under the AGPL-3.0 license. Commercial licensing is only required
for production deployment of proprietary modifications.

### Q: What about contributions?

**A:** Community contributions remain under AGPL-3.0 and are welcomed. By contributing, you agree that your contribution
can be included in both the open source and commercial versions (see CONTRIBUTING.md for details).

### Q: Can I get a trial commercial license?

**A:** Contact us to discuss trial periods and pilot deployments.
